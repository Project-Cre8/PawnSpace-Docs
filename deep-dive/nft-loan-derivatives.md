# NFT loan derivatives

**The tokenization of both loan orders and active offers creates a new asset class of NFT loan derivatives. Order and offer holders will have the freedom to trade their derivative asset tied to the loan. Since collateral is locked within the PawnSpace contract, an order is tokenized and tradeable the moment it is created. Orders that have not yet accepted a loan should contain a value equal to the locked collateral, minus the host blockchain’s transaction fee for unlocking the collateral. When an order enters a loan, its value will immediately change. Since an active order represents the obligation to repay a loan, its value should theoretically become negative. The time remaining to repay the loan should also affect price; potentially in a similar manner to expiration times in option markets.**   


**Upon creation of a pending offer, it exists only as a non-transferable record coupled with the corresponding order. Since value transfer does not occur prior to acceptance, the offer’s intrinsic value would be zero while it is still pending. When an offer is accepted and currency is loaned to the borrower, the value of the offer should represent the total repayment amount \(loan principal plus interest\) minus risk factors and transaction fees. There exist a number of variables, both external and internal to pawnspace, which could be considered when evaluating risk factors for an active offer. External risk factors could include the type/quality of the collateral and its associated project, as well as the potential for price volatility in that asset. Internal risk factors include PawnSpace features such as the demerit system for borrowers. An offer that was accepted by a user with a positive demerit score could be considered a riskier asset than one accepted by a user without any demerit points. At the same time, an offer whose corresponding order is not owned by the origin loan receiver could also be considered riskier, as the new borrower would not incur demerit points should they fail to re-pay.**  


**Overall, the loan derivatives market is going to be an experimental feature with truly unknown outcomes. As time progresses, data from the loan derivative market will be used to identify and develop new features to further improve the platform. There also exists potential for future protocols to build on top of loan derivatives to utilize their secured value in unique ways.**
