- Input the **"Amount"** and **"Interest"** that you want to lend, and choose the **duration of the loan**.

- Click on either **"Unlock xxx USDC"** (approves the usage of limited number of USDC to be managed by the contract. You will be required to approve transactions for subsequent loans - recommended) or **"Infinite Unlock"** (approves unlimited usage of USDC by the contract. You will not need to approve USDC in future loans). This will allow the transfer of your tokens if the Borrower accepts your Offer.
