# Exploring the different utilities of NFT collateralized loans and PawnSpace's features

### Example 1 - Instant Loan Conditions

Jacob wants to invest in and try out a new DeFi protocol but does not have enough liquidity on hand to do so. He is no longer comfortable taking out loans on AAVE as it would put his Health Factor in danger. Jacob however has some Decentraland Real Estate that he owns. He knows that his NFT real estate is really valuable and wants to keep ownership of it long term and hence cannot afford to sell it in the open market.

Jacob decides to use PawnSpace and list his NFT as collateral for a valuation & interest rate he deems is fair. Luckily, Belle an NFT & Decentraland Enthusiast sees Jacob's listing and feels that the valuation of the NFT is fair/undervalued and is willing to risk giving her funds to Jacob with the NFT as collateral in case of default. Belle agrees to an **"Instant Loan"** for Jacob's Loan Order, and the loan takes place smoothly.

Jacob receives his funds and tries to make profits on the new DeFi protocol he wanted to try out. He uses some of the gains to pay back the interest, gives back the principal and keeps the rest as profit. Jacob is happy as he receives his NFT back from escrow when he closes the loan. Belle is happy to get back her principal + interest from lending the loan.

### Example 2 - Debt Token

From the previous example, everything went well for Jacob, and he was able to pay back the loan in time. But what if it didn't? In this scenatio, Jacob borrows funds from Belle with his NFT as collateral. However, the new DeFi yield farming protocol that Jacob invested in crashed significantly overnight which resulted in him losing his borrowed funds. Jacob knows he has to pay back his loan so that he doesn't incure further losses from the NFT that he collateralized and decides to get rid of his debt. He knows he will lose his NFT nevertheless, because he is no longer able to pay back the loan, and wnats to minimize his losses and sell his collateralized NFT. Jacob does this by trying to sell his obligation to repay the loan or otherwise known as the **'Debt Token'**. The Debt Token being a representation/derivative of his debt for the underlying collateral has the valuation of the underlying debt. Anyone who sees potential in the growth of the collateralized NFT could buy this Debt Token and repay the loan to gain the NFT. 

Bob sees Jacob's DebtToken listing on Opensea at a valuation of 2 wETH while the loan to be repayed with interest was 3 wETH. Bob knows that during the duration of the loan, the floor price of the collateralized NFT had increased to about 6 wETH. He realizes that by buying the debt from Jacob and repaying it, he is still able to get that piece of land at about 4 wETH, and still get a profit of 1 wETH if he sells that land at the current floor price of that NFT collection (6 wETH). 

This ensure that Jacob minimizes his loss from the loan even though he loses his NFT worth atleast double the loan price at the time. Bob is ecstatic that he was able to make a couple of trades that allowed him to technically arbritrage his way to owning an NFT at lower than its actual floor price. Belle still comes out as a happy lender as she gets back her capital with interest.
