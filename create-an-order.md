- Input **"Auto accept amount"** \(will be replaced to "Instant Loan" in the new UI\) and **"Auto Accept Interest"** \(will be replaced to "Instant Loan Interest" in the new UI\) which are the loan condition that you accept automatically if a lender offers it. If you do not want to set the condition, put "0" to both.
