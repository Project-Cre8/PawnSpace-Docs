# Repay the Loan (Borrowers) or Withdraw defaulted collateral (Lenders)

    This page guides Borrowers on how to repay their loans and Lenders on how to claim their NFT collateral if the Borrower defaults.

## Repay \(for borrowers\)

- You can pay back the debt within a limited time (mutually accepted loan duration). After repayment, you will be able to reclaim the NFT that was deposited as collateral.
